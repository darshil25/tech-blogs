# Tech-Blogs

### List of Tech Stack used in this project

 - React in the frontend
 - Cloudflare workers in the backend
 - zod as the validation library, type inference for the frontend types
 - Typescript as the language
 - Prisma as the ORM, with connection pooling
 - Postgres as the database
 - jwt for authentication

Note :- Since this is my first basic project where I've worked with TypeScript and the backend (this app is on Cloudflare Serverless), it has minimal features. However, my focus was to learn backend development, and I have definitely learned a lot through this project. I will continue adding more features, considering how useful this is.
